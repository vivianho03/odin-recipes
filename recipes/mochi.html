    <h3>A Japanese inspired dessert with a Western twist! Mochi Waffles can be eaten for breakfast or dessert.</h3>
    <p>Mochi Waffles can be topped with a multitude of toppings, ranging from fresh fruits, like strawberries and blueberries, to crunchy add ons such as nuts, wafers, and candy. It is often simply topped with condensed milk or powdered sugar since it is sweet as is, but some people like to add syrups, icecreams, and more. </p>
    <p>The best mochi waffle is <em>crunchy</em> on the exterior of the waffle, and is sweet and <em>chewy</em> in the center when it is served immediately.</p>
    <p>I personally like my desserts simple. When I eat mochi waffles, I simply add either add a light drizzle of condensed milk or some powdered sugar.</p>
