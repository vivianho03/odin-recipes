    <h3>Original NESTLÉ® TOLL HOUSE® Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
    <p>This is the best chocolate chip cookies recipe ever! No funny ingredients, no chilling time, etc. Just a simple, straightforward, amazingly delicious, doughy yet still fully cooked, chocolate chip cookie that turns out perfectly every single time!</p>
    <p>The best chocolate chip cookies is <em>crunchy</em> on the exterior of the waffle, and is sweet and <em>chewy</em> in the center when it is served immediately.</p>
    <p>I personally like my chocolate chip cookies as is, without icecream, nuts, and the sorts. Just a simple chocolate chip cookie.</p>
