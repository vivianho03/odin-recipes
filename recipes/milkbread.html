    <h3>A Chinese Derived Bread Recipe! Chinese milk bread is often eaten as a snack or for breakfast. This bread recipe can be seen in other pastries like Hot Dog Bao and Bo Lo Bao</h3>
    <p>Milk Bread is a wonderfully light, moist and pillowy soft white bread that you will see in many Asian/Korean style bakeries or in Korean coffee shops served in thick slices usually with jam and butter. Flavors of milk and butter with a subtle sweetness makes this bread addictingly delicious and now you can make it at home!</p>
    <p>Milk Bread is best served hot with a <em>crunchy</em> exterior, and is sweet and <em>chewy</em> in the center when it is served immediately. It is topped with a nice honey egg mixture to glaze the top.</p>
    <p>I personally like my milk bread simple or in Hot Dog Bao. When I eat Milk Bread, I simply add either add a light drizzle of condensed milk or some powdered sugar and I often eat it as a snack or dessert.</p>

        <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>For the Tangzhong, mix 40g bread flour with 200g water in a saute pan. Turn on medium heat and keep stirring until mixture thickens to a paste.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for 6 hours. Bring out to room temperature 1 hour before use.</li>
            <li>Add bread flour, sugar, salt, dry yeast, powdered milk to a mixing bowl and mix gently with dough hook attachment.</li>
            <li>At low speed, mix in milk and egg and Tangzhong so that no flour is visible.</li>
            <li>Add in room temperature unsalted butter and mix at low speed.</li>
            <li>A Slowly turn up the speed to high and mix until all dough sticks together.</li>
            <li>Take the dough and fold it around and underneath itself shaping a smooth ball. Place dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 40 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>Test the dough by poking your finger down into the middle. If the dough does not spring back, it is ready.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal parts (by weight). Take one piece of dough and fold it over itself. Turn it 90 degrees, slap it on table and fold it over itself again. Using both hands, mold the dough into a ball. Repeat with rest of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll each ball of dough out flat. Fold flatten dough using thirds. Turn 90 degrees, and roll dough into a roll, pinching it together at the seam. Place 3 molded dough into a baking pan and let it rest for 30 minutes, letting it rise.</li>
            <li>Brush with egg wash and bake in the oven, preheated to 355Â°F for 25-30 minutes.</li>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>*Favorite toppings include: syrup, powdered sugar, fresh fruits, whipped cream, liliko'i butter.</li>
            <li>*You can substitute dairy milk for your non-dairy milk of choice if you wish.</li>
            <li>*You can add flavoring to the mochi waffle itself as well, like chocolate powder, matcha powder, and more!</li>
            <li>Whether using active dry yeast or instant yeast, this recipe does not require you to activate the yeast in lukewarm water and sugar beforehand. The yeast gets added to the rest of the ingredients in the mixer all at once.</li>
            <li>You will want to make the whole recipe which yields two loaves because one loaf will disappear in no time.</li>
